# Search-n-Rescue-Robot
This project's aim was to create a search and rescue robot which oriented itself through a building and saved people. This was simulated with a small  robot, a maze and three cylindrical objects representing humans. The aim was to collect three humans or cylinders within three minutes and logically, the faster the rescue, the higher the chances of the person surviving. In order to accomplish this, the robot used grippers with two degrees of freedom which enabled it to both pick up and store the wounded humans on its main frame. The robot oriented itself using five light sensors to follow a continuous line in the maze and three ultrasonic sensors which sensed the walls. This project was inspired and given by the institution of design science at Lunds tekniska h√∂gskola in the course Service Robotics. This project is in progress.
